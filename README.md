# GNN-Based-Drug-Target-Binding-Affinity-Prediction
GNN-Based Drugâ€“Target Binding Affinity Prediction A deep learning approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model drugs as molecular graphs and predict their binding affinity with protein targets. Applied on benchmark datasets like Davis and KIBA for drug discovery research.
